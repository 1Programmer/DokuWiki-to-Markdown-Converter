This page explains installing SilverStripe manually, without the use of (the easy to use) Web Platform Installer, and instead of Apache on Windows. See [[installation-on-windows]] to learn about those ways to install SilverStripe on Windows.
===== IIS 7.x =====

IIS 7.x ships with Windows Vista and Server 2008 or later.

A [[installation-on-windows-server-manual-iis|full guide is available]] on installing SilverStripe on Windows Server, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008 R2 or Windows 7.

==== Troubleshooting ====

On high traffic sites you might find that you start getting "The FastCGI process exited unexpectedly" errors.  This is related to PHP/IIS on FastCGI rather than anything SQL specific.  There are plenty of resources on the internet if you Google "PHP The FastCGI process exited unexpectedly".

To fix this, [[http://learn.iis.net/page.aspx/246/using-fastcgi-to-host-php-applications-on-iis-70/#PHP_Recycling_Behavior|follow this guide on best practise setup]] for FastCGI applications on IIS.

IMPORTANT: You should ensure you are using the latest version of the sqlsrv driver. sqlsrv 1.1 is the latest, and works considerably better than 1.0. If possible, use PHP 5.3 as well.
===== Installing on IIS 5.1 and 6.0 =====

  * Microsoft has no URL rewriting module for anything less than IIS 7.x. This will mean your URLs are like yoursite.com/index.php/about-us rather than yoursite.com/about-us. However, if you do want friendly URLs you must you must buy or use other URL rewriting software: 
    * IIRF: http://iirf.codeplex.com/
    * ISAPI_Rewrite: http://www.helicontech.com/download-isapi_rewrite3.htm
       * (The freeware, lite version should be fine for simple installations.)
    * If you have 64-bit windows, you can try this one: 
        * http://www.micronovae.com/ModRewrite/ModRewrite.html
  * Instructions for installing PHP IIS 5.1 and 6 may be different that for 7. See http://learn.iis.net/page.aspx/248/configuring-fastcgi-extension-for-iis60/
  * On XP, you need to disable 'Check that file exists' (See [[installation-on-windows-pi]])
