====== Customizing the Default Theme ======

Unlike another popular blogging tools editing the site title is locking into the template. You can't do it from the CMS by default. This is one of the design features of SilverStripe, to keep the CMS lighter from configuration.

Changing the site name and tag line is pretty simple anyway with the default theme. You just need to open 1 file with your standard text editor (NotePad, TextMate etc) and swap out the title
